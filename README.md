# There are two resolutions 

The default screen resolution is 1366 x 768 so you will immediately see the website in this resolution. 

The other screen resolution is 1920 x 1080 so you will only see the website in this resolution if you have a 1920 x 1080 monitor or you can change the resolution by accessing Google's Chrome DevTool (Shift + CTRL + J). 

You can change the resolution in the index.CSS file. Line 288: 

@media only screen and (min-width: 1920px)   /* change 1920 to 2560 for a resolution of 2560 x 1440 */ 

Why not only a single resolution? Billions of people are now using their smartphones to browse the Internet so you have to make your websites 'responsive' to whatever screen resolution their smartphones are using. So if you develop a website for a 1920 x 1080 resolution, you should probably also make that website 'reponsive' to the iPhone 13.
